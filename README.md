Capstone project for [Object Oriented Java Programming: Data Structures and Beyond Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/java-object-oriented) a Coursera/UCSD track designed in conjunction with Google.


## Week 1
* built a graph class to represent social network data as an Adjacency List.
* built a node class to represent nodes in the graph.
* wrote the basic graph methods (adding nodes, retrieving node's neighbors etc).
* wrote a method to get a user's egonet.
* wrote a method to get all strongly connected components.
* wrote unit tests in JUnit.

## Week 2
* researched and identified:
*     easier problem: Identify trend setters and trend followers.
*     harder problem: Assuming the starting point of a provided user, how many people does a video reach? What does the shape of the new graph look like?
* wrote a [proposal](https://github.com/bdauer/analyzing-social-network-data-using-graphs/blob/master/scope_and_problem_definition.md) describing the problems and plans for solving them.

## Weeks 3-5
* wrote method to identify trend setters.
* wrote methods to track generations of information flow for a viral video.
